  <strong>Structured AI Workflow Management for Developers</strong>
</p>

## <img src="extension-archive/art-kit/SVG/icon-target.svg" width="24" height="24" align="center"/> The Problem We Solve

Modern AI-assisted development lacks structure and control:

- **No Context Preservation** - Manually rewriting prompts and agent instructions across sessions
- **Zero Cost Visibility** - No way to estimate costs before execution
- **Fragmented Workflows** - Switching between multiple tools with no orchestration
- **Lost Knowledge** - Business logic and coding standards scattered across conversations
- **No Reusability** - Every project starts from scratch with manual setup

AI Agency provides a structured, visual system that **eliminates manual prompt engineering** and brings workflow automation to AI-assisted development.

### Core Features

**Agent Management**
- Template-based agent creation with role specialization
- System prompt management with tech stack context
- Model selection and temperature control

**Visual Schema Designer**
- Custom-built canvas for database design
- Entity-relationship modeling with validation presets
- Export schemas to implementation-ready formats

**Workflow Orchestration**
- Multi-step execution plans with dependency resolution
- Cost estimation before execution (token counting + model pricing)
- Parallel supervisor validation with retry logic

**Decision Matrix Engine**
- JSON-based business rules without AI invocation
- Conditional branching based on project context
- Dynamic task assignment to specialized agents

**Data Persistence**
- File-based JSON storage for all entities
